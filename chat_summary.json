The AI confirmed this action and subsequently asked the user two questions: whether they had a specific shade of dark red in mind and if the change should be applied globally or to specific sections. The user was also presented with additional features for consideration, including a color palette for background customization and a preview feature for real-time changes, among others.\n\nNext, the user requested to change the background to brown. The AI acknowledged this and posed similar questions regarding the desired shade of brown and whether the change should be universal or section-specific. After that, the user asked to change the background to blue. The AI again confirmed and queried about the specifics of the project as it reiterated the options related to the shade and application of the blue background. Alongside this, the user was presented with yet another list of potential features, including a soft blue color palette and optimizations for text legibility against the new background.\n\nThroughout the conversation, the AI supported each request and sought clarification to ensure that the changes met the user's needs, while also offering a range of features to enhance the user experience.",
