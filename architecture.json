Initially, the user asked to change the background to brown. The AI prompted the user with two questions: whether to change the entire website background to brown or just specific sections, and what shade of brown they preferred, offering options for light or dark brown. The user confirmed the request to change the background to brown. Subsequently, the AI acknowledged it would work on this change.\n\nLater, the user requested to change the background to blue, and the AI posed similar questions, asking if the user had a specific shade of blue in mind or preferred a general blue theme, and whether the change should be applied universally or on specific pages. Following this, the AI provided a checklist of potential additional features that could enhance the background, such as a soft blue color palette, a color theme toggle, and dynamic backgrounds, among others. The user indicated that they wanted a soothing blue palette and ensured that text and interface elements were legible against this background. The AI confirmed it could change the background to blue and then asked the user for a more detailed project description.\nUser: change the background to be bright green\nAI: Understood, I will change the background to light brown.\nUser: Change the background to be light brown\nAI: Sure, I will change the background to dark red.\nUser: change the background to be dark red\nThis is the user's current request of changes to be made: change the color to be yellow"
